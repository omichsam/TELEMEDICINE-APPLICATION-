# Assignment Title: Hands-on Project: Integrating Frontend and Backend

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to provide students with practical experience in integrating the frontend and backend of a web application using Node.js and Express. Students will build the backend of the telemedicine application, which includes:
- Patient management
- Doctor scheduling
- Appointment booking
- User authentication for patients

This project will help students understand how to create a REST API, perform CRUD operations, manage user authentication, and handle data securely and efficiently.

---

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, students will design and develop the backend telemedicine application. The application will allow:
- Patients to create accounts, log in, book appointments, and manage profiles.
- Doctors to manage schedules.
- Administrators to oversee the system.

Students will create necessary database tables, set up an Express.js server, implement user authentication, and integrate core functionalities.
